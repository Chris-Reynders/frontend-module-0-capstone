## Day 4 Exercises


1.  In an image element, why is the `alt` attribute important?
  - This attribute is used by screen readers or in case the image fails to display.
2.  What determines if an image element is inline or block?
  - The placement of an image determines if it will be inline or block. If you add the image element inside of a block it will appear inline with the text, but outside of a block the image forms its own block.
3.  What are the benefits of `jpg` or `png` image file formats?
  - .jpg files are best suited for photos with many different colors. .gif and .png are better for just a few colors.



1.  What is the benefit of specifying the height and width of images in CSS compared to specifying in the HTML?
  - This allows you to change multiple images at once by editing the CSS instead of having to change each image individually.
2.  What is an image sprite, and why is it useful?
  - A sprite is a single image used across different parts of an interface. Usage of sprites can improve page load times.
