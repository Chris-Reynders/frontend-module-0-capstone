## Day 1 Exercises

1.  On a website, what is the purpose of HTML code?
  - HMTL code is the language a developer uses to create and modify elements of a website, it 'describes the structure of a web page,' as the book puts it.
2.  What is the difference between an element and a tag?
  - A tag is used to open and close an element; tags define elements, and make up their start and end points.
3.  Why do we use attributes in HTML elements?
  - Attributes give us more information and can be used to customize or change values within elements.
4.  Describe the purpose of the head, title, and body HTML elements.
  - Heading: Used to order sections of HTML, provides information that will not appear in the main web page
  - Title: Element typically found within the Heading; can be used to identify the page or provide additional information. This text appears at the top of each tab in supported browsers and is not located in the main page of the website.
  - Body: A group of elements that comprise the main browser window of a web page.
5.  In your browser (Chrome), how do you view the source of a website?
  - Right click > View Source *OR* type "view-source:" before the URL, e.g. view-source:http:www.examplewebsite.com
6.  List five different HTML elements and what they are used for. For example, `<p></p>` is a paragraph element, and it is used to represent a paragraph of text.
  - `<b></b>` is a paragraph/text element that changes the text to bold
  - `<img src="" alt="">` displays an image with the option of alternate text if the image fails to load.
  - `<a href>` is used to create hyperlinks
  - `<h1>, <h2>, etc.` are header elements that change all included text to a customizable format
  - `<title>` changes what is displayed in the tab at the top of the browser
  - `<br />` adds a line break
7.  What are empty elements?
  - Empty elements do not contain any text between tags, and the tags are usually self-contained e.g. `<hr />` or even `<hr>` do not require a closing tag.
8.  What is semantic markup?
  - Semantic markup is geared toward screen readers and can change the inflection of speech output. Elements like `<em></em>` or `<strong></strong>` usually change the visible text to indicate emphasis with bold or italics and screen readers will usually read the selected text differently. This is different from structural markup like `<h1></h1>` that only changes the visible appearance of text and is used more for organization.
9.  What are three new semantic elements introduced in HTML 5? Use page 431 in the book to find more about these new elements.

  - <article>
